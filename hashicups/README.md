## Hashicups

Hashicups is a local service we can spin up to
give us a lifelike API to test against
and make terraform learnings.


### Starticups

Start the service by running `start.sh`.

Run the `create-user.sh` script to ensure the necessary user is created.

Then source the setenv file by running: `source setenv`.
